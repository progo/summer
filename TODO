TODO


- Make sure you can define more than one variable in a line.
- Multiple evals and definitions in one line
- column sum to answer some issues:
    - when collecting numbers save the column #
    - @csum will sum up those numbers in the right column.

- ideas about quantities:
    5 op
    3 op
    12 eur
    <@sum:op = 8>
